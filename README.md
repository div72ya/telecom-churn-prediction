# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 🚀 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn. It combines data analysis, model development, and an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Customer churn leads to significant revenue loss in telecom companies. Identifying high-risk customers early enables businesses to take proactive retention actions and reduce churn.

---

## ⚙️ Key Highlights
- Applied **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance  
- Compared multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Achieved **~81% recall** for churn prediction  
- Used **SHAP** for model explainability  
- Built a **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions

## 🧠 Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~61%     |
| Gradient Boosting   | ~62%     |
| Random Forest       | Best Model |

**Key Metric:**  
➡️ Recall (Churn Class): **~0.81**

---

## 🔍 Features Used
- Tenure (Months)  
- Number of Complaints (Last 3 Months)  
- Average Payment Delay (Days)  
- Service Rating (Last 6 Months)  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers with **low tenure** are more likely to churn  
- **High monthly charges** increase churn probability  
- **Frequent complaints** strongly indicate churn  
- **Payment delays** signal dissatisfaction  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Focus on **early-stage customers (first year)**  
- Offer **personalized retention offers**  
- Improve **complaint resolution systems**  
- Monitor **payment delays proactively**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- SHAP  
- Streamlit  
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
